# sst-benchmarks

This repository contains benchmarks and related scripts and tools for studying
SST-Core's performance and scalability. Learn more about SST [here](https://sst-simulator.org/).

Currently, it includes:

- Benchmarks
- [Containers](sst-containers/README.md)
- A memory model
- [Debug Use Cases](debugCases/README.md)
- [AI Trials](aiTrials/README.md)

### The benchmarks (found in their respective directories):
- [pingpong](pingpong/README.md) - simulates messages bouncing back-and-forth in one or two dimensions.
- gameoflife - an SST-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
- [phold](phold/README.md) - a benchmark widely used to assess the scalability and performance of parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) systems.

### Containers
the `sst-containers` directory contains a container file for running SST-core
on either a desktop or a Cray EX supercomputer. It also provides
[documentation](sst-containers/README.md) on how to build and deploy the
container.

### Memory Model
The `memoryModel` directory includes a Jupyter notebook with a script that can
be used to estimate SST core's memory usage and experiment with ideas on how to
reduce its memory footprint.

### Debug Use Cases
The `debugCases` directory contains small, focused scenarios (called use case
stories) that demonstrate situations where a debugger may be desirable. We use
these stories to examine the capabilities of SST's debugger and use them to
motivate "wishlist" features that could be added to future versions. See the
[README](debugCases/README.md) for details.

### AI Trials
The `aiTrials` directory explores the impact of applying various "wishlist"
prompts using GPT to alter an example Jupyter notebook-based workflow.  See the
[README](aiTrials/README.md) for details.
